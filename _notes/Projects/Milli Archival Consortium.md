*## The Scene: https://milli.link

After the International Archives Week 2020, Venkat from NCBS, Dinesh and Bhanu from Janastu and Prasoon who was ex-QAMRA came together to build a platform, to create a consortium of archives under the banner of **Milli**. 
It was around this time that Shafali and I, applied as UX Designers to this budding organisation. Milli.Tech worked for a year after that from Sept 2020 to Oct 2021*


During this time, we attempted to design a platform that attempts to democratise the Archive. This is the story of that journey though quite specific to my experience through the topic.

I came in with a vague idea of what an Archive was. I would still be hard-pressed to tell you how different an Archive is from a museum or a library. I did understand that Milli wanted Archives to be more like a library or the inside of a well-loved book. A place for [Marginalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia), play, learning and creativity. 

If you would like to know about more archives, I host a list here [South Asia - Awesome Digital History](https://micahchoo.github.io/awesome-digital-history-South-Asia)

Anyway back to the basics as I learnt them--


## What is an archive
---
### Archives as a place of contest
An archive usually has a purpose for storing, preserving and categorising historical documents of a certain kind. The documents collected often depend on the purpose of the archive. Some times archives have private letters, land records, copyrighted films, propoganda, taboo items. Each of these items then are entered into the **Archival Record** *(more on this later)* by the Archivist. The items on the Archival Record represent different interests and have various stakeholders. Even the founding of an Archive is often a function of one party's interest. There are corporate archives, governmental archives, institutional archives among many others. This makes every archive a place of push and pull where there is constant negotiation between different interests, changing environments *(because archives are meant to be long-term)*, different people, differing narratives etc. 


Therefore the questions about the Archive that become important
	- Whose material enters the archive? 
	- Who uses the archive?
	- Who describes the archive? 
	- Who interprets the archive?


So if there is a conflict and contest, we must first establish the theatre in which the contest lies, specifically for what Milli-Tech was trying to do with the platform. 

### What makes an Archive
An Archive is made of archival items at its core. "Archival Items" could be anything - [images of space](https://archive.org/details/hubblespacetelescopecollection), [apps](https://archive.org/details/apkarchive) [songs](https://archive.org/details/folksoundomy), [logos](https://archive.org/details/logoarchive), [clothes](https://www.blanknoise.org/ineveraskforit) or archives themselves

But Archives are not just individual items - but also the collections of these items which also then became an item (not entirely true, but serves the purpose). 

For example, an Archive on the Indian Partition may have found objects, which may have letters, which may be of two different periods, and between two specific people. This is an example of a collection tree. (diagram here)

>Found objects<br>
	|<br>
	| Letters and Correspondence<br>
	| |<br>
	| | 1950-1960<br>
	| | | <br>
	| | | Ismat and Issac <br>

In the sub-sub-sub-sub collection "Ismat and Issac"
the item, we have might be a letter from Issac to Ismat on the 23rd of July, 1956

An item (eg. the letter from Issac to Ismat on the 23rd of July, 1956) is made majorly of two parts - for an archivist atleast.


#### What is in the letter
#### Every other question about the letter
	- Who wrote it to whom?
	- When did they write it?
		- What paper and ink did they use?
	- Where did they write it from?
	- Where was it sent?
	- Where there other letters before this one?
		- What was in those letters
	- What other things were happening when this letter was written?
		- Does it make the letter more important or less important?
	- Who owns these letters now?
	- Are we allowed to make digital copies?


......... and many many many more

These questions become a part of different proccesses like accessioning, surveying, arrangement, description, ingesting, creating access points etc. 

You can go through these worksheets that the University of Florida has provided to get an understanding of these processes
[Worksheets & Forms - Archival Processing - Guides @ UF at University of Florida](https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/archivalprocessing/docs)
Some also follow additional steps when digitizing an archival item like the National Archives of UK like so
