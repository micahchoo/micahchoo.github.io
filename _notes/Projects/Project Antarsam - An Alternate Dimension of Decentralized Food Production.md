## Overview
Imagine a world where the legendary Subhashchandra Bose never perished and continued his fight against the British with assistance from the Japanese. He then stood against the Americans and Japanese, who divided their control over north-west and north-east of the combined region of India and Pakistan. This project takes a unique spin on the years of nation-building, focusing primarily on resource allocation for food production due to recurring famines from the 1940s to the 1960s.

## The Breakthrough and Resulting Innovation
A radical breakthrough from nuclear science led to the discovery of isotopes, which drastically improved food yield. Consequently, the nation invested in a distinctive internet structure, unlike the one we are familiar with today. The new internet, named Antarsam, was created to facilitate peer-to-peer food production and transportation.

This household method of food production functioned like a decentralized power grid. Higher producing parts stepped up to meet the demand in lower producing parts without the need for intermediaries, all facilitated by the p2p Antarsam internet. We also meet, Paul, a times traveller (a being who traverses possibilities rather than time), acts as our primary character. He shares insights on the stark differences between his last visited universe (where you and I exist) and the current one, specifically the drastic differences in politics.

## The Antarsam Community Meeting
A special Antarsam Community Meeting welcomes both our revered Netaji and our special guest, Paul Anthony George. Paul hails from a timeline where the struggle for Independence was won peacefully. However, in his world, they would remain as puppets of capitalist entities. 

### The Decentralization of Production
The main focus of this gathering is to discuss a system that mirrors our internet in Paul's timeline but fits into our Antarsam. We aim to make food distribution as decentralized as possible.

Despite our highly efficient and awarded public goods and people transport system, a significant amount of waste is generated in the process of production and transportation. The issue has been exacerbated by rebel attacks on our central farms.

### The Game-changing Interventions
The committee introduces two interventions that will revolutionize the system:

**Intervention 1: Mrutaru or Nectar** - We've harnessed the power of genetics to create a house plant that can generate a perfect nutritional mix when combined with the right ingredients. We estimate that merely three plants in a house can create 200 kilos of liquid food every week for a month.

**Intervention 2: Annacharkha Machine** - This machine connects to the cycles installed mandatorily in every household in the cities. It transforms the nutritional mix into liquid food through the act of cycling, potentially helping tackle urban female obesity.

Further research is being carried out to create diverse food options using simple tablets that can change nutritional sets and tastes of food by unleashing harmless bacteria that edit the Mrutaru's Genes in a specific way.

We christen this entire system 'Langaar'. The incorporation of women into the labor force will potentially boost our production by five times in the next two years.


# What was explored through this activity

in keeping with the given brief of exploring alternate histories and futures 
We started with a scenario that involved 

1. a thingamajig - an artifact
2. in a place
3. with a name
4. drawing inspiration from an ecological system

in my case 

1. drawing inspiration from an ecological system - ants producing and distributing liquid food
2. thingamajig - liquid food packets and their decentralised production and delivery system
3. place - bengal
4. name - antarsam


each of these four required a speculative exploration of its own
1. ecological system - i imagined a politics of logistics centered around ants producing and distributing liquid food
2. which led me to the thingamajig of 
	1. **Intervention 1: Mrutaru or Nectar** - We've harnessed the power of genetics to create a house plant that can generate a perfect nutritional mix when combined with the right ingredients. We estimate that merely three plants in a house can create 200 kilos of liquid food every week for a month.
	2. **Intervention 2: Annacharkha Machine** - This machine connects to the cycles installed mandatorily in every household in the cities. It transforms the nutritional mix into liquid food through the act of cycling, potentially helping tackle urban female obesity.
3. place - 
	1. where would it have significantly altered the current timeline, the bengal famine of 41 and the consecutive famines that hit the country till the 60s. suddenly in the 60s in the current timeline - india encourages the green revolution - i wanted to see if in another timeline, food would have shifted political systems entirely
	2. i also wanted to explore the material rammifications of such a change on the supply-chain
		1. i posit that it could have developed into an alternate internet centered around federalising the demand and supply fo food needs down to the neighbourhood/village. i explored a version of a phone that is community-based and shared among the community and primarily deals with food logistics and then with other things
4. name - i wanted to explore linguistic roots to familiar words like the internet and food processor. The locating in bengal helped me play with the etymology of words to arrive at 
		1. antar- in between and sam-short for samachar (news) as a word for the internet
		2. anarcharkha - anar means grain and charkha means a weaving wheel, i wanted to explore how these different metaphors could change the way the technology manifested in this world

Overall this world was a means for me to imagine the knock-on effects on small changes as way of being optimistic about the power of the individual's rage against the machine and the thinly veiled arbitrariness of the systems that we take as cold hard fact
