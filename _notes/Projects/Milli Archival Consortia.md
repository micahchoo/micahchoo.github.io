After International Archives Week 2020, Venkat from NCBS, Dinesh and Bhanu from Janastu and Prasoon who was ex-QAMRA came together to build a platform, to create a consortia of archives under the banner of Milli. 
It was around this time that Shafali and I, applied as UX Designers to this budding organisation. Milli.Tech worked for a year after that from Sept 2020 to Oct 2021
<br>
During this time, we attempted to design a platform that attempts to democratise the Archive. This is the story of that journey though quite specific to my experience through the topic.
<br>
I came in with a vague idea of what an Archive was. I would still be hard-pressed to tell you how different an Archive is from a museum or a library. I did understand that Milli wanted Archives to be more like a library. A place for [Marginalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia), play, learning and creativity. 
<br>
If you would like to know about more archives, I host a list here [South Asia - Awesome Digital History](https://micahchoo.github.io/awesome-digital-history-South-Asia)
<br>
Anyway back to the basics as I learnt them--
<br>
An Archive is made of archival items at its core. 
"Archival Items" could be anything - [images of space](https://archive.org/details/hubblespacetelescopecollection), [apps](https://archive.org/details/apkarchive) [songs](https://archive.org/details/folksoundomy), [logos](https://archive.org/details/logoarchive), [clothes](https://www.blanknoise.org/ineveraskforit) or archives themselves
<br>
But Archives are not just items, they are collections and sub-collections. For example, an Archive on the Indian Partition may have found objects, which may have letters, which may be of two different periods, and between two specific people. This is an example of a collection tree.

>Found objects<br>
	|<br>
	|Letters and Correspondence<br>
	| |<br>
	| | 1950-1960<br>
	| | | <br>
	| | | Ismat and Issac <br>

In the sub-sub-sub-sub collection "Ismat and Issac"
the item, we have might be a letter from Issac to Ismat on the 23rd of July, 1956

Some times archives have private letters, land records, copyrighted films, propoganda, presently taboo items. This makes every archive a place of conflict and contest. Who tells what story about what thing is therefore an important question?

So if there is a conflict and contest, we must first establish the theatre in which the contest lies, specifically for what Milli-Tech was trying to do with the platform. 

An item (eg. the letter from Issac to Ismat on the 23rd of July, 1956) is made majorly of two parts when it lives inside an archive.

The content: What is in the letter
