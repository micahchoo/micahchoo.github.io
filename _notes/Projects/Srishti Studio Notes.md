# Seeing, Being, Doing: design
# Gathering Spaces:
*Responding as a creative practitioner to places where humans and non-humans gather*


This was the description for a course that Naveen, Navin, Siddhant and I co-facilitated for 4th year HCD students. One of the thematics focused on understanding and exploring gathering spaces, or spaces where humans and non-humans come together. We wanted to experiment with multiple practices of situated making as a form of creative practice. Our goal was to unravel questions about learning from, being in, and making in gathering spaces, as well as using metaphors from these spaces to inform an "HCD" practice. The students engaged in a range of activities such as visiting and mapping the site, reading literature, building artifacts, cross-annotating and co-iterating with collaborators, and participating in different roles within the space. The importance of honesty, speculation, seeing and connecting diverse experiences and knowledge, and making as critical vehicles of inquiry started to become apparent.

### The brief: 


Beyond the human-centeredness of design, lie the varied and vast untold stories of non-human spaces, artifacts, systems. Of particular importance is what we term as gathering-spaces: spaces where human and non-human actors come together to make it work; make it a place. How to observe and make visible how humans are positioned in these spaces, how the ways they gather depend on the nature of gathering-spaces and the other humans and non-humans shaping the space and the gathering? 

We will explore how to learn to be, see and make in and with gathering-spaces. The project space is oriented towards enabling multiple practices of situated making as a form of creative practice, with an anchoring in auto-ethnographic design and a focus on unraveling questions around:

-   What and how might we learn about what we are seeing vs not seeing? 
    
-   What and how are we being and not being in these spaces? 
    
-   When we are making, what can the gathering spaces teach us about our-self and the kind of design we want to do? 
    
-   What metaphors can we pull from these spaces to inform our practice? How will we judge the suitability of the metaphor and position it within a larger historical body of work?

# Modes of Engagement

## 1. Reading and Annotating
- This involves gaining an understanding of various histories, current scenarios, individuals, locations, objects, and narratives.
- It encourages you to cross-reference your archive with reflections on your own identity.

## 2. Mapping and Seeing
- This mode is about discovering diverse perspectives.
- It includes the task of mapping these distinct viewpoints across various dimensions, including spatial, temporal, and cultural dimensions, and across various senses - such as sounds, smells, and sights.

## 3. Participating and Being
- This mode encourages you to understand and experience various roles within a space, including roles as customers, sightseers, designers, outsiders, artists, and more.
- It asks you to consider how these roles you adopt impact your practices.
- It encourages active participation and involvement in these various roles.

## 4. Making and Bridging
- Here, the focus is on creation as a means of communication and collective thinking.
- The act of creation is seen as a form of participation and reaching out to others.

## 5. Archiving and Exhibiting
- This mode involves the creation of archival artifacts that capture the collective memory of your engagements.
- It also includes reflecting on how your practices are informed by these archival artifacts.

## 6. Participatory and Collaborative
- This mode emphasizes engagement that involves shared decision-making and action with others.

## 7. Co-creating and Co-learning
- This mode involves the shared creation of artifacts or knowledge and learning from each other in the process.

# Capabilities

## 1. Speculate
- The ability to construct plausible concepts in the face of risk and limited information.

## 2. See & Connect
- The ability to deliberately uncover and merge diverse experiences and forms of knowledge.

## 3. Be Honest
- The ability to be self-aware and transparent in expressing your position.

## 4. Make
- The ability to create new artifacts, things, and relationships that did not previously exist as tools of critical inquiry.

# Weekly Activities

The outlined course involves weekly activities ranging from orientation and site visits, to building abstracts and co-creating evaluation processes. The activities also include exercises in mapping, reading literature, journaling, and artifact creation. The course encourages active participation with collaborators and stakeholders and continual engagement with the archive.

# Learning Outcomes

Through these modes of engagement and capabilities, the following outcomes are expected:

1. Development of a toolkit based on responsiveness as a methodology.
2. The ability to formulate and implement a proposal.
3. The ability to express your identity as a practitioner in space and time.
4. New perspectives on human and technology interactions.
5. The ability to observe and make connections between different patterns in theory and practice.
6. Improved skills in deriving metaphors to inform your practice.
7. Enhanced sense for collaborative creation and action.
   
This structure provides a comprehensive framework for engagement, capability building, weekly activities, and anticipated learning outcomes.
