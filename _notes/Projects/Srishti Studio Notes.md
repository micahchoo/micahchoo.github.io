# Seeing, Being, Doing: design
# Gathering Spaces:
*Responding as a creative practitioner to places where humans and non-humans gather*


This was the description for a course that Naveen, Navin, Siddhant and I co-facilitated for 4th year HCD students. One of the thematics focused on understanding and exploring gathering spaces, or spaces where humans and non-humans come together. We wanted to experiment with multiple practices of situated making as a form of creative practice. Our goal was to unravel questions about learning from, being in, and making in gathering spaces, as well as using metaphors from these spaces to inform an "HCD" practice. The students engaged in a range of activities such as visiting and mapping the site, reading literature, building artifacts, cross-annotating and co-iterating with collaborators, and participating in different roles within the space. The importance of honesty, speculation, seeing and connecting diverse experiences and knowledge, and making as critical vehicles of inquiry started to become apparent.

### The brief: 


Beyond the human-centeredness of design, lie the varied and vast untold stories of non-human spaces, artifacts, systems. Of particular importance is what we term as gathering-spaces: spaces where human and non-human actors come together to make it work; make it a place. How to observe and make visible how humans are positioned in these spaces, how the ways they gather depend on the nature of gathering-spaces and the other humans and non-humans shaping the space and the gathering? 

We will explore how to learn to be, see and make in and with gathering-spaces. The project space is oriented towards enabling multiple practices of situated making as a form of creative practice, with an anchoring in auto-ethnographic design and a focus on unraveling questions around:

-   What and how might we learn about what we are seeing vs not seeing? 
    
-   What and how are we being and not being in these spaces? 
    
-   When we are making, what can the gathering spaces teach us about our-self and the kind of design we want to do? 
    
-   What metaphors can we pull from these spaces to inform our practice? How will we judge the suitability of the metaphor and position it within a larger historical body of work?

### Modes of Engagement (in no particular order)

  

1.  Reading and Annotating
    

-   Learning to read histories, presents, people, places, artifacts, narratives
    
-   Cross-annotating your archive with reflections of your identity
    

2.  Mapping and Seeing
    

-   Exploring different ways of seeing
    
-   Mapping these different ways that you are seeing things in different dimensions - spatial, temporal, cultural, across sounds, smells, sights, sense of a place, safe spaces
    

3.  Participating and Being
    

-   Understanding what it might mean to “be” in the space in different ways - customers, sightseers, designers, outsiders, artists etc. 
    
-   How do these roles that you occupy inform your practice
    
-   What would it mean to participate in any of these roles
    

4.  Making and Bridging
    

-   Making as a way of communicating
    
-   Making as a way of thinking collectively
    
-   Making as participating
    
-   Making as reaching out
    

5.  Archiving and Exhibiting
    

-   Archival artifacts for the collective memory of your engagement
    
-   Remembering how your practice is informed by your reflection
    

6.  Participatory and Collaborative 
    
7.  Co-creating and Co-learning 
    

  
  

### Capabilities

  

1.  Speculate: Take risks while constructing plausible concepts even with limited information. 
    
2.  See & Connect: Consciously unearth and combine diverse experiences and knowledge forms. 
    
3.  Be Honest: Be aware of and transparent in articulating your position.
    
4.  Make: Bring about that-which-does-not-yet-exist; bring artifacts, things, and people into novel assemblages as critical vehicles of inquiry.
