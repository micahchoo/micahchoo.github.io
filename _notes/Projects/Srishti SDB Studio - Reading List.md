In Drawing the Bombay Plague, Ranjit Kandalgaonkar combined imagery from two collections: photographs from the Wellcome Collection and satirical cartoons from HindiPunch, a monthly magazine archived at the Asiatic Library, Mumbai. He produced archival driven artwork in the form of an interactive online sketch. In doing so, he encapsulates the different imaginations of the plague to recover under-represented facts, figures, and people's voices. Kandalgaonkar imagines the drawing as a record to view the plague through a new lens that could inform future research through validation of some of the lesser known aspects of the plague years.

While I acknowledge the limitations of self-observation and reflection through autoethnography, it is important to note that practice-based research is impossible without them. Indeed, reflexivity is key to developing a critical consciousness of how the practitioner-researcher’s identity, experiences, position, and interests influence their creative practice (Pillow 2010, 273). I have also attempted to mitigate these limitations in this methodology by stipulating that the practitioner-researcher A) approach the creative activity from a clearly defined research question; B) observe his/her activities in situ, but interpret these observation records (creative notes, drafts, research logs) after a time period that allows for a distanced perspective; and C) supplement these observations of process with media-specific analysis of the creative artifacts themselves (as discussed in a later section). A clearly defined research question not only helps to determine the scope of the creative practice, it provides a framework for examining the creative activity.

Reflective analysis is probably the method most frequently applied by practitioners to their creative projects; we create a work, caught up in the process and the drive to bring a mental model of the ...

Thanks to this focused frame, the practitioner-researcher can more easily distinguish and recognize the effects of the “trouble” of the unfamiliar “special motive” on his/her familiar activity. This benefits not only real-time observations, but also reflection on creative activities and later interpretation of the observation notes, creative drafts, and research logs. Similarly, by distancing the practitioner-researcher both in time and perspective (the latter by applying post-textual analysis) from the creative practice, s/he is able to identify patterns in the creative process and narrative artifacts that may not have been apparent while the activity was underway. Combination of methodological approaches, therefore, provides a more robust approach to examination of creative practice than reflection or post-textual analysis provide on their own.

Launched in September 2019, the account spotlights long-forgotten artifacts — a TV appearance of a 1970s Lebanese pop diva; sepia-tone portraits of cross-dressing Egyptian women in the 1920s; prints of the Buraq, an androgynous mythological creature in Islamic tradition.

"I also want to convince you that what we're seeing when we see the Web is actually a radical break with previous categorization strategies, rather than an extension of them. The second part of the talk is more speculative, because it is often the case that old systems get broken before people know what's going to take their place. (Anyone watching the music industry can see this at work today.) That's what I think is happening with categorization."

[Decolonize This Place on Instagram: &quot;📝🧱💭• Imagine a class that teaches students for free what Columbia University does and stands for, like the below from globalize the intifada zine issued last year (available on our site):

📌 Columbia University stands on stolen Lenape land. The University was chartered as King’s College by King George in 1754 in Lower Manhattan, and to this day Columbia remains one of the largest landowners in so-called New York City. In its name and symbolism, Columbia is also a monument to colonization and patriarchal violence. After the American Revolution, the institution was renamed Columbia, in honor of the the mythical spirit of Christopher Columbus, the same genocidal conquistador and rapist whose likeness stands above Columbus Circle several miles south at Broadway and 59th street.

📌 Columbia University was founded by “slave-owners”/enslavers. Between 1754 and the U.S. Civil War, half of the men who presided over the school “owned” enslaved African people, and all were prime beneficiaries of the hemispheric plantation system. That system and its legacies remains inseparable from the general structure of global capitalism that Columbia as an institution has always been dedicated to growing and preserving, as is evident in the list of Wall Street oligarchs who continue to make up the board of trustees. Their accumulation of wealth has always been founded on the dispossession, incarceration, and brutalization of racialized populations.

[Brand Strategy &amp; Design on Instagram: &quot;🛺 Auto-letters from Kollam Town

These well-crafted names adorn Kollam’s autorickshaws and spread an extra serving of hues over the already quite colourful town. Most are well-considered forms mindful of what they say. Most are also well-aware of their canvas’s proportions and contours. 

1/7 Chakkulaththamma: References the deity at a temple in Thiruvalla. The old lipi ‘kku,’ and the way the ‘cha’ and ‘mma’ share parts are amazing. 

2/7 Veerappan: Indian bandit (and more infamously, poacher). It is somewhat strange to see the name on the auto. The driver wasn’t around for a conversation. 

3/7 Parthasarathy: ‘Charioteer of Arjuna,’ possibly referring to the deity at the eponymous temple in Pathanamthitta. The decorations on ‘pa,’ ‘tha,’ and the swash on ‘thy’ are direct references to Krishna, whom the name describes.

4/7 Mo-ncha-ththi: Self-reference wrapped in confidence. While the maybe-diacritics and certain swashes suggest an Arabic calligraphy connection, the window sticker makes it a happy cocktail of associations. 

5/7 Grace of God with a hint of the beach next door. The sunsets at Kollam beach are this red, thanks to the sand in a deep shade of mud. 

6/7 Layamol: Well-executed script-alics. Costed the auto-driver chettan 800 Rs. to get two words painted, in an hour. The people who paint these are pros in planning and high on craft. 

7/7 Nice: Sums up the series. That N knows what it does. 

Aashraamam ground here in the town is where most of these get painted. The artists—some of them—have mobile workstations mounted and carried on bikes. “They take suggestions and makes the word even better,” says a driver we spoke to. Word. 

The ✨ are so well-placed.
