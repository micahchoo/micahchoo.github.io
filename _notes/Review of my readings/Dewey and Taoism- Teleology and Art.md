--------------------------------------

Factual

* West suffers from Teleology or "a purpose-driven life" and exoticises the Eastern Traditions as an antidote, because the ends don't exist -which is imaginary
* ![[assets/img/Pasted image 20210305014932.png]]
* the Tao is spontaneity as well as letting go
* musings of marriage and love and why calculating is stupid because of innumerable variables
* brief discussion of the author's position on pragmatism

Ghost Actual

* the author is very funny
* must return to this text
