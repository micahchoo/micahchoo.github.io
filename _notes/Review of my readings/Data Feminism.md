# Data Feminism

1. Examine Power Chapter
	1. Those “complications” that Williams experienced—other women had had them too.
	2. “What we choose to measure is a statement of what we value in health,”
	3. The complexity of these intersections is the reason that _examine power_ is the first principle of data feminism,
	4. Matrix of domination: four domains: the structural, the disciplinary, the hegemonic, and the interpersonal.
	5. **Structural domain**
		Organizes oppression: laws and policies.
	6. **Disciplinary domain**
		Administers and manages oppression. Implements and enforces laws and policies.
	7. **Hegemonic domain**
		Circulates oppressive ideas: culture and media.
    8. **Interpersonal domain**
    	Individual experiences of oppression.
	9. How does this come to pass? Let’s take a minute to imagine what life is like for someone who epitomizes the dominant group in data science: a straight, white, cisgender man with formal technical credentials who lives in the United States. When he looks for a home or applies for a credit card, people are eager for his business. People smile when he holds his girlfriend’s hand in public. His body doesn’t change due to childbirth or breastfeeding, so he does not need to think about workplace accommodations. He presents his social security number in jobs as a formality, but it never hinders his application from being processed or brings him unwanted attention. The ease with which he traverses the world is invisible to him because it has been designed for people just like him. He does not think about how life might be different for everyone else. In fact, it is difficult for him to imagine that at all.
