    - summary: 
    - part of:
- A good reference for putting practice as research
- use of a sidebar for footnotes, abbreviations etc.
- citizen participation matters in the creation of public services, they make it more whole
- This goes beyond academia into tech development and other ways to involve the users in more complex fashions
- in the past people wrote about the ways user participation should be, which may/may not be relevant today
- collaborative design was pushed as power and politics but the everydayness of the collaborations needs to be talked about
- research has been catching on to the intermediate design required in the various collaborative community projects that are happening
- sts has made strides in understanding these processes as co-constitutive to the progress of such progress and that these process may undermine/"straddle" the idealistic politics of collaborative design
- Celib is the focis of this article investigating these intermediary actions and how they feed into each other and how it was//affected the competencies of the organisation
- strategizing needs to move beyond a compromise or an excludable factor and to be seen as a more internal constituent changing results, audiences,modes of participation, methods
- By looking at mundane work in collaborative design/silent design we problematize the over emphasis of idealisations and highlight the other (care) work that goes into it
- through a designer retrospective, we hope to elaborate on the concepts of collaborative design
