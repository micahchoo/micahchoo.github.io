## Overview
Imagine a world where the legendary Subhashchandra Bose never perished and continued his fight against the British with assistance from the Japanese. He then stood against the Americans and Japanese, who divided their control over north-west and north-east of the combined region of India and Pakistan. This project takes a unique spin on the years of nation-building, focusing primarily on resource allocation for food production due to recurring famines from the 1940s to the 1960s.

## The Breakthrough and Resulting Innovation
A radical breakthrough from nuclear science led to the discovery of isotopes, which drastically improved food yield. Consequently, the nation invested in a distinctive internet structure, unlike the one we are familiar with today. The new internet, named Antarsam, was created to facilitate peer-to-peer food production and transportation.

This household method of food production functioned like a decentralized power grid. Higher producing parts stepped up to meet the demand in lower producing parts without the need for intermediaries, all facilitated by the p2p Antarsam internet. We also meet, Paul, a times traveller (a being who traverses possibilities rather than time), acts as our primary character. He shares insights on the stark differences between his last visited universe (where you and I exist) and the current one, specifically the drastic differences in politics.

## The Antarsam Community Meeting
A special Antarsam Community Meeting welcomes both our revered Netaji and our special guest, Paul Anthony George. Paul hails from a timeline where the struggle for Independence was won peacefully. However, in his world, they would remain as puppets of capitalist entities. 

### The Decentralization of Production
The main focus of this gathering is to discuss a system that mirrors our internet in Paul's timeline but fits into our Antarsam. We aim to make food distribution as decentralized as possible.

Despite our highly efficient and awarded public goods and people transport system, a significant amount of waste is generated in the process of production and transportation. The issue has been exacerbated by rebel attacks on our central farms.

### The Game-changing Interventions
The committee introduces two interventions that will revolutionize the system:

**Intervention 1: Mrutaru or Nectar** - We've harnessed the power of genetics to create a house plant that can generate a perfect nutritional mix when combined with the right ingredients. We estimate that merely three plants in a house can create 200 kilos of liquid food every week for a month.

**Intervention 2: Annacharkha Machine** - This machine connects to the cycles installed mandatorily in every household in the cities. It transforms the nutritional mix into liquid food through the act of cycling, potentially helping tackle urban female obesity.

Further research is being carried out to create diverse food options using simple tablets that can change nutritional sets and tastes of food by unleashing harmless bacteria that edit the Mrutaru's Genes in a specific way.

We christen this entire system 'Langaar'. The incorporation of women into the labor force will potentially boost our production by five times in the next two years.
