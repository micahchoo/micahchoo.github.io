[[Project Antarsam - An Alternate Dimension of Decentralized Food Production| Read the Speculative Project ]]
## Project Background
The Antarsam project is a speculative exploration into alternate histories and potential futures, inspired by ecological systems, technological artifacts, cultural contexts, and linguistic roots. Antarsam represents an immersive dive into the possibilities that emerge when the threads of history, technology, and ecology intertwine to weave a new societal fabric.

Our unique exploration started with a set of intriguing variables:

1. An ecological system: Ants producing and distributing liquid food
2. An artifact (thingamajig): Liquid food packets and their decentralized production and delivery system
3. A place: Bengal
4. A name: Antarsam

## Ecological System: Drawing Inspiration from Ants
Ants' unique social structure and cooperative behavior offered a profound insight into the possibilities of a politics of logistics centered around the production and distribution of liquid food. This exploration further inspired the conceptualization of the "thingamajig."

## The Artifacts
In envisioning an alternate reality, we introduced two key interventions:
1. **Mrutaru or Nectar**: By harnessing the power of genetics, we conceptualized a house plant capable of generating a perfect nutritional mix when combined with the right ingredients. This led to the hypothesis that a mere three plants in a house could produce 200 kilos of liquid food weekly.
2. **Annacharkha Machine**: This bicycle-powered machine transforms the nutritional mix into liquid food. We imagined it as a mandatory installation in every household in the cities, potentially addressing urban female obesity through its operation.

## Place: The Bengal Famine and Beyond
The choice of Bengal as the focal point for our exploration wasn't accidental. Bengal, scarred by the 1941 famine and subsequent famines until the 1960s, presented a unique opportunity to imagine how significantly different timelines could be altered. Instead of the green revolution that swept India in the '60s, we posited that a radical shift in food production could fundamentally change political systems. We also explored the material implications of such a change on the supply chain, envisioning an alternate internet centred around federalising food demand and supply down to the neighbourhood or village level. 

## Name: The Power of Linguistics
The choice of the term "Antarsam" was a deliberate linguistic exploration. By merging "antar-" (meaning 'in between') and "sam" (short for 'samachar', meaning 'news'), we sought to challenge traditional metaphors associated with the internet. Similarly, the term "annacharkha" (with 'anar' meaning 'grain' and 'charkha' referring to a 'weaving wheel') was a symbolic exploration of how different metaphors could shape the manifestation of technology in this alternate world.

### A Ripple Effect of Small Changes
The Antarsam project was a fascinating exploration into the knock-on effects of small changes in the existing socio-political and technological landscapes. It offers an optimistic perspective on the individual's power against the seemingly monolithic systems, challenging the notion of those systems as cold hard facts. It reminded me that even the most formidable of systems are ultimately a construct of our collective imagination and actions.
