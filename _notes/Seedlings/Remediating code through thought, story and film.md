# Remediating thought, story, film, code

[Coding Is for Everyone—as Long as You Speak English | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/coding-is-for-everyoneas-long-as-you-speak-english/)


1. How do you introduce computational thinking in low-literate contexts using non-linear, media-centric programming metaphors?
2. What are the rules and grammar of this metaphor?
