# Descriptions

When evaluating tools for collectives, it's essential to consider various aspects that align with the collective's needs and objectives. Here are some questions to guide the selection process:

1. **Export Capability**: Does the tool allow for easy export of data and content? Can you extract and save your collective's information for backup or migration purposes?

2. **Compatibility with Other Tools**: Do the export options of the tool work well with other tools commonly used by your collective? Consider the compatibility of file formats, integrations, and interoperability.

3. **Self-hosting Options**: If your collective has a server or infrastructure, can the tool be self-hosted? Is there documentation or support available for setting up and maintaining the tool on your own server? Assess the feasibility and resources required for self-hosting.

4. **Multi-Device and Screen Size Support**: Is the tool optimized for multiple devices and screen sizes? Can it be accessed and used effectively on different devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones?

5. **Collaboration Capabilities**: Does the tool provide features and functionality to facilitate collaboration among collective members? Consider features like real-time editing, version control, commenting, and task management that support collaborative work.

6. **Affordability**: Is the tool relatively affordable for your collective's budget? Compare the pricing plans and subscription costs of different tools, keeping in mind the financial constraints of Indian collectives. Consider the value and features offered in relation to the cost.

7. **Open Source and Security**: If the collective deals with sensitive data or wants to have control over the underlying technology, is the tool open source? Open source tools provide transparency and allow for customization, enhancing security and privacy.

8. **Input Variety**: Can the tool accommodate different types of input, such as text, voice, and multimedia? Consider the flexibility of the tool in accepting various forms of content and communication.

9. **Accessibility and Delivery**: If voice input is used, can the tool be accessed through a phone call or other accessible means? Ensure that the tool supports diverse accessibility needs and delivery methods.

10. **Trade-off between Speed and Accessibility**: If there are tools that offer faster performance but limit accessibility, while others provide better accessibility but with slower performance, consider the trade-offs and prioritize based on the collective's specific requirements.

Remember to customize these questions based on the unique needs, context, and goals of your collective. Exploring resources like [thesephist.com/projects](https://thesephist.com/projects/) may also provide additional insights into tools suitable for collectives.
