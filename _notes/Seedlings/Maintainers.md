## From Mark Youngs chapter on invisible infrastructure breakage and maintenance 

Firstly, invisibility sometimes denotes the way certain forms of infrastructural systems in urban environments are often deliberately removed from view. As we walk inner city streets, for example, many of us are not aware of the sewerage pipes that carry waste underneath the ground simply because we do not see them. Yet as Kaika and Swyngedouw have argued, while today urban networks often become ‘buried underground, invisible, rendered banal and relegated to an apparently marginal, subterranean world’, this has not always been the case. Throughout early modernity, for example, infrastructural systems in Western urban environments were often celebrated as powerful symbols of progress and promise and for this reason located in highly visible spaces (Kaika & Swyngedouw, 2000). According to this perspective then, the invisibility which characterizes infrastructure in cities of the global north is an absence from view, and one that captures a particular phase in the historical development of [[infrastructural systems]].

Understanding the apparent permanence and stability of infrastructural services to be a material achievement means that breakdown and malfunction can only appear as an anomaly; as a failure of design and construction. From this perspective, we have little reason to pay attention to the work performed by technicians in seeking to understand the nature of infrastructure, insofar as this perspective casts these forms of activity as addressing anomalous, rather than essential aspects of the nature of the technology itself.

According to this perspective, maintenance is understood broadly, as any activity performed by users which contributes to the stable functioning of a technical artefact or system over time, a category which includes, but is not limited to, practices of cleaning, repair, modification or the replacement of parts. This conception of technology is most often applied to certain classes of objects, such as car engines which are naturally associated with practices of maintenance such as monitoring both oil and water levels, periodically replacing minor components and cleaning the contacts of the battery.

Rather than being bundled up within the device then, the agency of a technology understood in this way is distributed and emerges from the relation between a user and an artefact over time. For this reason, breakdown assumes a more ambiguous status in this context. Whether a device is broken depends here not only on the physical state of the artefact but also on the capabilities of the user. In this way, breakdown becomes relativized; while manufacturing flaws or problems arising through wear and tear may render a device inoperable in the hands of a novice, a skilful user can often find ways to work around such problems in order to maintain the function of the technology. Furthermore, because enduring function is premised upon the performance of maintenance activities by the user, many forms of breakdown are considered part of the normal life cycle of a technology rather than anomalous events. Understanding a technology as process therefore not only relativizes, but also naturalizes a wide range of different forms of breakdown.

we overlook the actions of others by interpreting maintenance and repair work as responses to anomalous occurrences rather than natural events in the life of a technology

This invisibility is not only a result of failing to see the significance of maintenance, but sometimes of failing to see it at all. This occurs in part because, it is extremely common for maintenance and repair activities to be deliberately situated out of view. Maintenance of services such as subways and roads, for example, often occur ‘after hours’ when they are expected to cause least disruption. One of the central goals in the provision of infrastructural services is often to cultivate a sense of reliability and permanence that encourages repair work to be performed out of sight. Furthermore, the tendency for maintenance to recede from view is further exacerbated by the fact that these forms of work are often not evenly distributed throughout society.

‘maintenance work is (often) performed by people who do not hold positions of wealth or privilege in any given society. To focus on maintainers is therefore to look at the lives and labor of women, ethnic and racial minorities, migrants and laborers whose positions are contingent and vulnerable’ (Russell & Vinsel, 2018). Similar observations are made by Graham and Thrift, who also note how ‘it is often the poorest people in a society that are concentrated in maintenance and repair jobs’ (Graham & Thrift, 2007). Like those aspects of infrastructure explored above then, a growing body of research points to ways in which the forms of activity required to keep such systems going also often become relegated to the margins of visibility.

The maintenance of bridges can be understood to divide into two kinds; the first includes maintenance activities which are based on existing knowledge of predictable processes and thus can be often be scheduled in advance to prevent common forms of problems from occurring. These include forms of preventive maintenance such as painting and washing the bridge, lubricating bearings, fixing pavement cracks or cleaning and resealing expansion joints. The second are those based upon inspection or observation which respond to less predictable problems that emerge throughout the life of the structure and include some forms of preventative maintenance, such as snow and ice removal or wearing surface repairs, and all forms of corrective maintenance such as the repairing of corroded piers or structural steel, the replacement of bearings or the fixing of impact damage

The example of the bridge helps illustrate what is perhaps the most important feature of this relationship because it reveals the extent to which apprehending the technology as form is derivative of the deeper understanding gained through approaching it from the process perspective. There are two general ways in which an understanding of the bridge as form can be understood to be derivative; Firstly, understanding the structural integrity of the bridge to be exclusively a product of design and construction represents an impoverished conception because it overlooks much of the work that is actually required to keep bridges standing. Unlike the process perspective then, perceptions of technology as form are sustained through the negation of the significance of human labour to the ongoing life of a technology. Secondly, the perception of the bridge as form is derivative in the sense that it is itself made possible by the activities it ignores. For the apparent stability over time that this approach attributes to the production of a technology results not only from sound design, but also from continuous activities of maintenance and repair.

Henke’s study for example, demonstrates how repair work on heating and cooling systems in buildings often involves working with customers perceptions that a system is malfunctioning—a perception that can be ‘fixed’ by using the visible readout of instruments to demonstrate that the system is in fact functioning correctly (Henke, 2000). Orr’s study of copy machine technicians draws similar conclusions in highlighting how the work of maintaining and repairing copy machines includes both fixing the actual machine itself and modifying the way in which customers use the machines through training, signs and modifications to the machines themselves. Such studies thus reinforce insights from the preceding section, in which it was suggested that for a technology encountered as process, breakdown represents not a physical state of a device, but rather a relation between a device and a user. Indeed, Orr utilizes just such a relational concept of breakdown to characterize the nature of copy machine repair work itself, noting that;

Throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, sociologists and feminist theorists exploring the theme of invisible labour for example, produced a wealth of studies that succeeded in utilising ethnographic analysis to make visible activities which had previously been rendered invisible under then dominant modes of conceptualizing work. These studies, which often focused on gendered practices performed inside the home ‘were crucial academically, enabling scholars to “see” the work and visualize workers in places previously invisible to conventional sociology’ (Crain, Poster, & Cherry, 2016). If gaining a deeper understanding of technological systems depends, as Steven Jackson suggests, on a similar shift by which maintenance and repair are made ‘empirically and conceptually familiar, even normal’ (Jackson, 2014), a good place to begin will be by applying the same careful ethnographic methods of analysis to everyday practices of infrastructural maintenance.

This study contends that if we want to understand more about the technologies we use then we might want to attend less to cases of breakdown in which such systems cannot be used, and focus more instead on the kinds of activities that occur while such technologies are in use. This will involve shifting the focus in historical studies of technology away from traditional narratives which privilege activities of design and construction and more towards the analysis of everyday practices of maintenance, repair and modification. While the recent turn towards use in historical studies of technology and the growing body of literature that has resulted5 has prepared the ground for future studies of this kind, more work remains to be done. For if the black box of infrastructure can indeed be opened, it will be done so not by focusing on failure, but rather by turning an ethnographic eye towards everyday practices of maintenance and the conception of technology they imply.

Here are some additional notes on various topics:

- **Ethnographic Studies of Repair (ESR)**: ESR focuses on the ethnographic examination of repair practices. It explores how repair activities often remain invisible in society, with everyday breakages and repair work hidden from view. Repair people themselves are often marginalized and overlooked. By understanding repair as a process and considering the interplay of artifacts, networks, and human agency, the visibility and significance of infrastructures and technologies can be better understood.

- **Observing Infrastructures and Technologies**: Observing and gaining visibility into infrastructures and technologies can have several benefits. It can lead to the development of alternatives and enhance resilience by providing options. It can foster diversity and specificity of use, enabling alternative ways of using technologies. Additionally, observing and participating in repair practices can promote solidarity, transforming low-income jobs into essential and valued roles. Exploring these observations can inform human-centered design practices.

- **Epson Printers Boobytrap**: The article "[Epson Boobytrapped Its Printers](https://doctorow.medium.com/epson-boobytrapped-its-printers-7d0ef9b894d4?s=09)" highlights an incident where Epson printers were intentionally designed to prevent the use of third-party ink cartridges. This raises questions about the ethics and implications of such practices by technology companies.

- **City as a Learning Space**: The city is a unique learning space that cannot be fully understood through traditional media channels. Living and actively participating in the city allows individuals to truly see and experience its dynamics. By observing participation and actively engaging with the city, individuals can contribute to and bring about change.

- **Small Gathering Interfaces**: Small Gathering Interfaces explore the concepts of interfaces, smallness, and gatherings. They involve understanding the interactions and linkages within spaces, both human and non-human. By speculating and designing interfaces that reflect these understandings, designers can create meaningful and contextually relevant experiences for gatherings in various settings.

- **Seminar Approach**: The seminar approach involves a series of explorations and reflections on smallness, interfacing, materiality, the designer's role, and gatherings. Through iterative design iterations, students can refine their interfaces and incorporate theoretical frameworks and personal reflections. The seminars culminate in the presentation of the final interface design accompanied by a reflective account of the student's position and its influence on the design process.

- **Interfaces for Gatherings in the Small**: This concept focuses on moving beyond human-centered design to consider the broader narratives and interactions within gathering spaces. By observing and engaging with these spaces, designers can gain insights into their own positionality and the kind of work they want to do. They can draw metaphors from these spaces and evaluate their suitability within a historical context, informing their design practice.

These notes cover a range of topics related to repair practices, visibility of infrastructures, technology ethics, urban learning, small gathering interfaces, and the exploration of gathering spaces.
